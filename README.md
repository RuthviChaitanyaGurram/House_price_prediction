# House_price_prediction
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using various regression models. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about house characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other relevant features.

Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict house prices based on input features. The models used in this project include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features using StandardScaler.

Model Development: Multiple regression models are implemented using scikit-learn library in Python, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualization: The relationship between actual and predicted house prices is visualized using scatter plots to assess the accuracy of the machine learning models.

Usage:
To run the code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the machine learning models.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about houses including features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and is included in the repository.

Conclusion:
The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the best-performing model with the lowest MAE, MSE, and RMSE, indicating its effectiveness in predicting house prices based on the given features.
